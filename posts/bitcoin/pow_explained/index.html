                    <p>So you&rsquo;ve read the theory, but want to understand Bitcoin programmatically. In this post we will analyse the
core codebase written in C++ to understand how one can generate and include a block in the chain. Starting with
the atomic unit of construction in this context, a block is a grouping of transactions that alter the state of
the ledger. For example, a <code>coinbase</code> transaction may be included by a miner to collect a block reward. But in
order for these to be processed by the network, a miner must provide a proof of work for the serialization of
the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nVersion</code></li>
<li><code>hashPrevBlock</code></li>
<li><code>hashMerkleRoot</code></li>
<li><code>nTime</code></li>
<li><code>nBits</code></li>
<li><code>nNonce</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The class definition of a block header is shown in the following snippet, of particular interest is <code>SerializationOp</code>
which tells the compiler how an instance of this class should be serialized and <code>GetHash</code> which returns a 256-bit
unsigned integer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The implementation of <code>GetHash</code> calls another function <code>SerializeHash</code> passing a dereferenced pointer to its context.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From here, <code>CHashWriter</code> is established which computes the digest via the <code>CHash256</code> class.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We can see that <code>Finalize</code> writes and flushes the hash to the input buffer. It is important to note that
this actually computes <code>SHA-256d</code> (double) in an effort to prevent &ldquo;length-extension&rdquo; attacks.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Assuming this process has given us a valid digest of our input, how can we convince other participants to
append our block to their view of the chain? This is where the consensus parameter <code>bnTarget</code> comes in.
For brevity, we will ignore how this is chosen but I will note that this is dynamic - the network adapts it
based on mining speeds. Honest nodes will thus accept a gossiped block under the condition that the arithmetical
representation of its hash is less that that of the current target.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To recompute a new hash, we need some variability in the form of <code>nNonce</code>. As there is no way to predict what input will lead to
a desired hash, all we can do is increment it. There&rsquo;s a useful example of this in the following test helper.</p>

<p>Providing the final hash meets the criteria and enough nodes know about it, subsequent miners will include it as
<code>hashPrevBlock</code> in their constructions.</p>
