      <description>Since I am on lock-down due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic I decided this would be a good time to write up some notes from my recent visit to Phoenix, Arizona.

Fortunately, it was still well attended despite the obvious health concerns but the Linux Foundation made every effort to accommodate guests.</description>
